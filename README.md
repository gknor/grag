Guarded Retrieval Augmented Generation example

**Abstract**

**Problem**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are at the forefront of natural language processing advancements, thanks to their ability to understand and generate human-like text. However, challenges arise due to their tendency to occasionally produce irrelevant or misleading outputs and their inherent knowledge cutoff. This limitation means they might not be updated with the most recent information, necessitating the exploration of effective solutions beyond mere fine-tuning.

**Methodology**: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) and its advanced iteration, Guarded Retrieval Augmented Generation (GRAG), were explored as potential solutions. RAG utilizes an intermediary approach, fetching relevant facts from external knowledge databases, grounding LLM outputs in verifiable data. Building on this, GRAG incorporates guardrails - specific controls that guide the model's outputs, such as circumventing politically charged topics or adhering to a set dialogue path. The methodology central to GRAG involves defining example queries or utterances and embedding them within a semantic vector space. This allows for rapid decision-making based on the semantic proximity of a user's query to predefined utterances.

**Conclusions**: The utilization of GRAG offers a more efficient and swifter alternative to the basic RAG method. It effectively mitigates the challenges of inaccurate or unrelated outputs from LLMs and ensures more precise and targeted outcomes.

**Relevance to practitioners and business**: As businesses integrate LLMs, GRAG offers means to ensure accuracy and relevance in AI outputs, catering to diverse business needs, from customer support to knowledge management.
